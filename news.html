    <p>January 2020</p>
      <p>
      About a week ago a young man who is part of our Lighthouse family reached out to me over a series of text messages that
      started with “I feel like I need to talk” and ended with “Instead of thinking about the things I should be thinking
      about, I find myself constantly doing things to distract myself from reality. I just feel like I’m drowning and do not
      know what to do.” A long texting conversation followed, over the course of a few days, as I helped him walk through what
      Hebrews 12 says, “Let us throw off everything that hinders us and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with
      perseverance the race marked out for us.” He completely owns where he is at - but has felt trapped, “drowning” for a
      while now, hindered and entangled in the consequences of his choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our enemy has been playing this hand for centuries, tricking us into thinking this person, this activity, or this
        thing will finally make us happy. Once we’ve been snared and we realize that the promise was a lie, we then tend to
        choose to either live in denial or stay trapped by the guilt and shame. The enemy then assaults you with “you’re so
        stupid” and “you better not tell this to anyone,” working hard to convince you that telling the truth and asking for
        help out of the trap will never work. It takes great courage to finally do it, to reach out and say, “I have gotten
        myself in a mess and I need help.” Oh man - I want Lighthouse to be full of the kind of people who celebrate at that
        moment; people who respond just like the forgiving father in Luke 15, who when he saw his son returning home after
        squandering his inheritance told his servants to bring a ring and a robe for his son and to prepare a feast, saying
        “For this son of mine was dead and is alive again, he was lost and now is found.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This father knew that while the lost inheritance was deeply painful for the son, what mattered most was that their
        relationship was restored. I love making sure that kids know telling the truth is a good thing, that being honest
        (instead of hiding or pretending) is the way to build trust and strengthen relationships and is the key to finding the
        real peace and joy that Jesus brings. The most requested song for the last few months at our weekly Lighthouse
        gatherings has been “Truth Be Told,” by Matthew West. The song ends with these words:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I really stand here unashamed?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know that your love for me won’t change<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh God, if that’s really true, Then let the truth be told<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This past year I’ve had young people come to me trapped in all kinds of unfortunate scenarios - self-harm, pregnancy,
        addictions (usually pornography), poverty, etc. I love being able to sit with them, listen to their plea for help and
        say, “Wow, telling me that took a lot of courage, I am so proud of you.” I know that this is what we have been called
        to do here - to be “The Lighthouse” that young people know about and can run to when things are out of control. A
        place where they can safely and completely tell their stories. </p>
      <p>
        So many of you give monthly to support this outreach and yet you never get to be here, never get to see what its like,
        never get to stand next to these kids who soak up love like dry sponges. Thank you for your faithfulness, for
        continuing to believe that your sacrifices are being put to good use. Many people, when they first hear about The
        Lighthouse, say nice encouraging things about what a good thing it is that we are doing. But when they hear that this
        outreach in little old Bunker Hill, Indiana is 100% staffed with volunteers and operates solely from donations mailed
        or hand-delivered, and that we’re about to complete construction on a 7200 square foot youth center paid for with
        cash, they realize that there is something more happening here than just “a good thing.” We could not do this without
        your help. Those of you who give are as much a part of what is happening as those who are serving on Wednesday nights.
        This year we received over $60,000 in donations, enabling us to continue construction almost to completion. All of the
        framing, electric, plumbing, heating and cooling (except for the gas lines), and almost all of the drywall, is now
        complete. I’ve included some pictures so you can see for yourself. Hopefully we’ll be able to move in and start using
        the building this spring. If you would like to come checkout the building I would love to show it to you.
