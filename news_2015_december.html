    <p>December 2015</p>
    <p>
        Leading this outreach to teenagers is exciting, unpredictable, and just plain hard. On a weekly basis I am
        excited to see solid character developing as I observe how one of our kids responds to a difficult set of
        circumstances. Lest I get too proud of the work we are doing and the progress we are making, I am quickly
        reminded of the pit of despair that so many are stuck in, due to circumstances beyond their control or the
        consequences of their own poor choices. I am often left wondering, is there any way we can rescue them. At our
        Lighthouse gatherings this fall we have been talking about our hearts, our character, about who-we-are. In so
        many areas of life, we are recognized by our achievements (or lack thereof). The awards and recognition given
        for achievement very often results in us striving to put on a great performance independent of the cost to our
        character. The nature of solid character development, however, cannot be driven by awards and recognition.
        Somehow we must demonstrate that the <b><i>rewards of being</i></b> outweigh the <b><i>awards of doing</i></b>. The challenge I have is in
        providing a way, an environment, that is safe for young people to admit their character flaws, to confess where
        they are struggling, and regardless of what they say, to be able to confidently say “this can change.” This is
        our mission here at The Lighthouse, to help young people find their way.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can see this truth, the importance of <b><i>who-you-are</i></b> versus <b><i>what-you-do</i></b>, as we read the Christmas story. What
        can a baby do other than make faces, silly noises, eat, and dirty his diaper? And yet there was such an
        incredible celebration at the birth of this baby named Jesus, even though at the time of his birth he could do
        nothing. The celebration and the hope was there because of <b><i>who the baby was</i></b>. Matthew 1:23 says, “ ‘Behold, the
        virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel’ (which means, God with us).” The
        angels, the shepherds, the wise men, Joseph, and Mary celebrated out of a sincere hope that this baby would
        eventually do great things because of who he was, “God with us.” I am convinced of this truth for the young
        people we are serving, that they will do great things if they first develop a deep and solid foundation of
        character rooted in a relationship with Jesus.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the last few months I have had multiple young men come and confess to me an addiction to pornography. Having
        endured the same struggle during my teenage years, I understand their shame and the hold that this false
        intimacy can take on a young man. Through one of our staff members, I have also heard of a student with an
        alcohol problem looking for help, with no clear guidance available to him through his family or his school. I
        don’t fault the school staff for this, how can they add substance abuse help to their already over-burdened and
        under-funded system? I want the Lighthouse to be able provide a shame-free transparent gathering for teenagers
        who sincerely want to overcome addiction, regardless of what it is they are a slave to. I want to provide a
        place where they can find hope, where they spend some time with us weekly and as they leave they think to
        themselves, “I believe.” I know this hope, this peace, because I have personally been set free. The hope is in
        Jesus, Immanuel, “God with Us”, of whom the prophet Isaiah says, “He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
        to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The world is in upheaval right now. The reaction of so many is that hope for safety for the future can be found
        in laws and wars and leaders. It is disheartening to see folks demanding solutions to the present dangers
        reported in the news, while there is little public outrage for the battles being lost in the war for our
        children’s hearts. In Matthew 10:28, Jesus said this to his disciples as he was sending them out into the world,
        “Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can
        destroy both soul and body in hell.” Please consider joining our Lighthouse team in the fight by supporting us
        financially. We are on track to finish the year with approximately $40,000 in the bank. Once we reach $50,000
        and get our building plans completed and approved, we should be able to begin construction on the shell of The
        Lighthouse Youth Outreach Center in Bunker Hill. With 50 teenagers here for our weekly gatherings and our
        monthly Red Circle leadership development group, we are at the maximum of what can be done in our home. We need
        a full-time Lighthouse facility so we can continue to grow and add more outreach like the addiction recovery
        mentioned above. For more information about our vision for this place and this outreach, you can read our past
        newsletters on our website at <a href="http://www.LHBH.org">www.LHBH.org</a>. You can also contact me directly at <a href="mailto:chris@LHBH.org">chris@LHBH.org</a> and 765-271-6687.
        I would love to come share our story with you personally or any group
        you are involved in, including your churches. If you would like to send a gift, you can mail it to The
        Lighthouse, PO Box 336, Bunker Hill, IN 46914. All gifts are fully tax-deductible.
    </p>
    <p>
        We sincerely thank those of you who are supporting us, whether it be with your time, your prayers or your
        finances. We simply could not do this mission without you. We are blessed with an incredible team of volunteers
        who help us weekly and partners like you. From our family to yours, we hope you have a peaceful and joyful
        Christmas season.
