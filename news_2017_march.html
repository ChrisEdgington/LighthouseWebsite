        Being misunderstood is such a painful thing. If you have ever had your
        motives questioned or been labeled as a “problem”, you likely know the
        pain I’m referring to. So often the default response of an adult to
        misbehavior or a perceived attitude of a teenager is to assume that this
        person has a “heart" problem. “They are challenging my authority,” or,
        “They are refusing to obey and follow instructions,” are often the
        internal conversations we have with ourselves in the midst of dealing
        with a “problem” child. The more I spend time with young people, the
        more I am convinced of how often we adults are wrong with these default
        assumptions of motives and our internal reactions; then, unfortunately,
        our response produces more undesired behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        Imagine watching a baseball coach working to teach a player how to
        properly hold the bat while standing in front of the pitcher. The new
        player steps up to the plate with hesitation, having little confidence
        that he knows how to do this the “right way”. The moment the bat is
        raised, he hears the coach, “Drop your elbow. Loosen your grip. Line
        your knuckles up.” The player drops his elbow just like the coach asked,
        but it was the wrong elbow. His fear of getting hit by the ball has him
        gripping the bat like it is the safety bar on his first roller coaster
        ride. As the pitcher winds up, every muscle in the body of this new
        batter tenses up and without even thinking about it he closes his eyes
        as the pitch heads towards him, ‘cause that is what happens when you’re
        afraid. The coach screams out more instructions, but the player just is
        not getting it, now he wants to just run and hide and get back into the
        dugout where nobody is looking at him.

        How often is this what is happening to teenagers in their social
        situations, in their classrooms, in their interactions with peers and
        adults? Now imagine the same scenario above, with a different response
        from the coach. After watching the new batter get into his stance, the
        coach walks over and leans in, whispering in the player’s ear while
        gently pushing down on his back elbow. “Relax, you’ve got this. Just
        keep your eyes on the ball.” His grip loosens up, his elbow is down. The
        coach had already instructed the pitcher to deliver a nice easy pitch
        down the middle. His knuckles are not lined up like they need to be, but
        the coach knows that is something that can be fixed later once the
        player has confidence in the batters box, so he says nothing about it.
        As the pitcher winds up, the coach steps back, and instead of thinking
        about how afraid he is of the ball making contact with his bones, the
        batter is only thinking about the bat making contact with that ball.

        For the last couple of years I have been working hard at intentionally taking a
        different approach to conflict and behavior problems and the results are
        incredible. Every time I encounter a situation that would commonly be identified
        as “rebellious teenage behavior”, I assume that instead of this being an
        intentional act of willful disobedience or defiance that its more likely an
        issue of a lack of training or bad training. That produces in me a desire to
        provide instruction and guidance on how to properly handle the situation. The
        way I often handle it is by immediately replaying what happened, with me
        role-playing the position of the “trouble-maker” and demonstrating a better way
        of responding or handling the situation. Every single time this happens - the
        end result is a smile, like they’ve just learned some super-secret ninja trick.
        And right away I know that this was not an issue of “I will not behave properly
        because I do not want to” but more likely an issue of “I cannot behave properly
        unless you show me how”. A little training is all that is needed. This is part
        of what we do here at the Lighthouse on our mission to “Help young people find
        their way.” Now, to be clear, we do not believe that the core problem of mankind
        is that we all just need some instruction. We all have a “heart problem” called
        sin that can only be cured by surrendering to Jesus Christ. We also talk about
        this regularly at the Lighthouse. Many have taken this step of faith and are
        seeing their “want to” changed from the inside out.

        We are close to being able to set a start date for construction of our
        Lighthouse Youth Outreach Center in Bunker Hill, but we still need help. We are
        about $20,000 short of having the funds to cover the cost of concrete. A couple
        weeks ago I mentioned this to a friend and he responded by saying he would give
        the first $1000, then he said, “I’m going to begin praying that 19 more people
        will respond in the same way.” Maybe its time for you to help? For more
        information about our vision for this outreach, you can read our past
        newsletters on our website at www.LHBH.org. You can also contact me directly at
        chris@LHBH.org and 765-271-6687. I would love to come share our story
        with you personally or any group you are involved in, including your churches.
        If you would like to send a gift, you can mail it to The Lighthouse, PO Box 336,
        Bunker Hill, IN 46914. All gifts are fully tax-deductible.
